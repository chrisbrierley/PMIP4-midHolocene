# PMIP4-midHolocene
This repository holds the scripts that were used to write a multi-model manuscript about the PMIP4 midHolocene simulations. It was coordinated by [Chris Brierley](c.brierley@ucl.ac.uk) and [Anni Zhao](anni.zhao.16@ucl.ac.uk) at University College London. 

The model status is presented in [data/README.md](data/README.md). You should be able to run this repository on a Pangeo Binder, but be aware that may take 30mins to load everything up to be ready to use
